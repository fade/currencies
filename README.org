This system defines an interface to the 1Forge currency exchange API,
which is the only one I've found that will allow me to query rates
based on a base currency within the free tier of access. You will need
to sign up at [[https://1forge.com][1forge API home]] to get a viable api_key, copy
config.template to config.lisp and change the lisp file as appropriate
for your own access token for any of this to work. The free tier is
limited to 1000 requests per day. This counter turns over at midnight
EST (New York, New York).
